This is not done, yet as it's a WIP. Basically each class will have their own .XML or .lua

Why?

Snipers should be slower and stealthier, and assault soldiers should be quicker + noisier. This is not the only reason, as a 
unique .lua/xml for each class will make it easier to customize each class, and making it unique.

CCS = Close Combat Soldier
Sniper = Duh, Sniper :P
