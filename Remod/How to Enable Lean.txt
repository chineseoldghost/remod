1) Navigate to Documents\My Games\Crysis Wars\Profiles\Whatever.
2) Open actionmaps.xml with some text editor, one with XML syntax highlighting will make the job easier.
3) Paste the following on a line right under <actionmap name="default" version="20">:

<action name="leanleft" onPress="1" onRelease="1" onHold="1">
  <key name="q"/>
</action>
<action name="leanright" onPress="1" onRelease="1" onHold="1">
  <key name="e"/>
</action>

4) Change "q" and "e" to whatever suits you.
5) Look for any other actions that use these keys by searching for "q" and "e" (with quotes) and change them.
7) G'day!
