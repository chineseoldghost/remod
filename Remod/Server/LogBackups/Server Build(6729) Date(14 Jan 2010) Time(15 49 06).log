CHAT Shinanigans to ALL:

CHAT Blablah to ALL:

CHAT Shinanigans to ALL:
   youre in armour mode but it takes your health not your armour
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   nice one shadow
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   yeah speed and strength are obviously more for mobility
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   oh, btw
CHAT Shinanigans to ALL:
   nah, i was in armour mode
CHAT Shinanigans to ALL:
   and it took my health, not my armour
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   crouching = - 50% recoil, prone -75% and in strength another 
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   -50%
CHAT OMG! Shadow to ALL:
   so crouching + strenght = 0 recoil?
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   should be
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   yep
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   quite fair i think
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   you're really vulnerable in strength
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it'll probably be more useful in PS
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   because in IA you're never safe
CHAT Shinanigans to ALL:
   more fully automatic snipers ;P
