CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   which i can't get rid of

   i'm quite limited :<
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   but you can still make speeds slower
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   and lower health a lot
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i did that at the beginning
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   that would do a huge difrence
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   in the tactical aspect
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   but currently slower speeds don't really work well
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   what was that last long sentence?
CHAT Nomad to ALL:

CHAT Blablah to ALL:

CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   low not seeing the shadow
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it's potentially negligible in wars because cloak is visible in wars
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   but it hardly is here
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   so it was just a huge unfair advantage for lowspec people
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   ...like me...
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   so when are you donn?

CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   with increased acurecy and damg
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   and a aimport
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   but limit view and you wouldn't be able to move
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   designing it from scratch is hard though
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   yea
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   if you have no team of coders
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   and modelers
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   keep the model

CHAT Nomad to ALL:

CHAT Blablah to ALL:

CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i wouldn't
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   but
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   say, for example, an LMG would really fit in
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   oh yea
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   and it should be mounted
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   *mount able
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   and it'd be required
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   to have good game balance
CHAT Nomad to ALL:

CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   what is?
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   the bullet drop
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   in this game?
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   all the bullets are set to as real values as possible
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   nice
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   that's from the days i was making this more tactical, lol
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   its so fun to snipe in bfbc2
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i wish i could run bfbc2
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   it feels so rewarding to shoot and hit a running guy with a heavy 50. c
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   al  bullet right in the face!
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i can (only) imagine
CHAT Nomad to ALL:
   boom
