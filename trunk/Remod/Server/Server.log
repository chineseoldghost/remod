CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   eh,, i think it'd be too much
CHAT Blablah to ALL:

CHAT Blablah to Team black:
   here
CHAT [PW]i59 to ALL:
   darn you! you set singleshot mode x))
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   also
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   if you guys have any ideas for textures that can be improved
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   not quality-wise
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   but like we made the blue container a Crynet Systems container
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   and generally just things to make the world a bit more atmospheric
CHAT [PW]i59 to ALL:
   Crynet systems? Where :D
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   well
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   blue containers
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   lol
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   purple actually
CHAT Shadez to ALL:
   wth
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it's nothing special though
CHAT Shadez to ALL:
   lag much all of a sudden
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   the container textures are gay
CHAT [PW]i59 to ALL:
   you should make weapon autodrop
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   so i couldn't put a big "Crynet Systems" on them
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   actually i could
CHAT [PW]i59 to ALL:
   when you die, all your weapons are dropped
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   son of a bitch
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   xD
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   yeah
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   but
CHAT Shadez to ALL:
   ROFL
CHAT Blablah to ALL:

CHAT Shadez to ALL:

CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   the FY also has incammo in PS btw
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   and i'm planning on giving the SCAR a tactical attachment
CHAT [PW]i59 to ALL:
   the autodrop could be easily programmed
CHAT [PW]i59 to ALL:
   If you want it, I could try writing it
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   you code?
CHAT [PW]i59 to ALL:
   yep
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   well?
CHAT [PW]i59 to ALL:
