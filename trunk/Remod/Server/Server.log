   are you sure it's not just you?
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:

   tell me
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   why this fails
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   I did

   and why it's a logical reason and not just yours
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i missed it then, so please, do explain again

   ??
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:

CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i won't
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   for balance reasons
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   then forget this mod :)
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i won't do that either
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   sorry but you're making such a fool of yourself it's kinda funny
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   unless you can tell me why it's bad, it's entirely you who doesn't like
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
    it
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   I just don't like how things are in this mod... its my opinnion now go 
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   ask others
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i know
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   that's fine
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   but you don't say "i don't like this because..."
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   some are cool but some really suck in my opinnion
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   all that's coming out is "THIS SUCKS11!&&11oneeleven" etc etc
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   then I will give you reasons...
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   great
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   now I gotta remember what
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   vehicle's handeling sucks because its harder to drive and speed is unre
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   alistic
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   okay, but that's still entirely your own opinion of it
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   why do you think i made it harder?
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   I don't know
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   okay, so you just don't like it
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   probably because you're not used to it
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   no And I gave you a reaso
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   no you did not
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   a reason would be likes
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   I did ... wtf
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   "the vehicles are too slow, it will tip the balance towards infantry"
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   which isn't the case here, but it's an example
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   nvm...
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   okay
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   sucks...

CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   you said why YOU dont like it
CHAT Blablah to ALL:

CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   but why do you think i did it?
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:

   it's not a realistic game
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   -.-
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   FYI, bullet speeds are realistic
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   Crysis 1 was
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   no it wasn't
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   it was
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   not really
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   omg
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   ?
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   just get this fixed
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   no
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   you're only bitching because YOU dont like it
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   tthe mod = fixed
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   not why IT effectively sucks
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   then ok
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   now if you'd say "this is good, but i don't like it" the "i don't like 
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it part" is actually mature and credible
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   Vtol back door is good.... ICV gun is good
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   when you say "this sucks BECAUSE i don't like it"... not so much
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   sniper damage is good
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   gauss damage 100% damage in torso and head
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   you're still only speaking from what YOU want
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   exactly
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   would making the gauss an insta-kill everywhere make the game better?
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   OMG TANKS SPEED LOOKS LIKE A JOKE HAHAHAHAHA
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   no. it would cause it to be overpowered
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   ahhaha
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   joke speed
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i think you're forgetting the ones and elevens
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i haven't touched tank handling yet
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it's just got a different massbox from the default
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   and no boost, obviously
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   that sucks
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i'll have to make em faster eventually to compensate for the loss of bo
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   ost
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   why no boost?
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   because it had no disadvantages
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   there's no reason not to boost
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   omg
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   + it completely voided any vehicle disadvantages
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   This game looks like... idk somethigng never seen before
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   eeh phone
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it's my birthday so lots of calls :P
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   eheh
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   did you hear that by any chance?
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   I did but didn't understand
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i just said dun dun dun, but i suppose the quality was too shitty?
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   It was better a little   say it again
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   yeah good
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   random dunns
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   lmao
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   cool
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   Say "I am going to make this mod cooler"
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   wtf why?
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   YAAAAY
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   If you get all of this working 100% will you had some new models?
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   what~?
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   why should i add new models?
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   attracts more people
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   yeah but it won't make the game better
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   boost started working for some reason :<
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   you never know
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   LOL CHUTE
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   sexy eh?
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   yeah lol
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   do you know Aegis?
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   yeah
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   Why don't you guys work together to make a nice mod?
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   because he doesn't make nice mods, really
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   I know :P True
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   he nicely illustrated that with the community patch
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   yeah I really don't like it
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   by turning it into... something...
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   lmao
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   ok if you say yes :D
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   :P
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   This mod is cool but needs fixing :)
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   you just want me to throw sprinkles on it
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   can you increase explosions radius?
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   if just i knew flash, i would revamp the HUD
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   yeah
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   awiy
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   wait
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   look
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   you hitted me but no damage
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i missed you
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   that hurt
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   69hp left
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   oooh ok
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   21hp :<
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   the gauss is ridiculously powerful in combination with other things
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   let me see what happens if I hit balls
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   see?
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   just hitting the chest and then meleeing in armor works, even
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   and it's pretty team-work oriented, you know
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   oh and the AAs are totally not done
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   I know... but who cares  about team work in Crysis Wars? this game its 
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   not battlefield bad company 2
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it's not Crysis Wars, lol
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   LAW 1 shot kill infartary?
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   nope
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   then its lame
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   fly like a bird baby
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   lame!!!
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   of course it's not
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it's an anti-vehicle weapon
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   That means I can shot you a rocket in real life? you don't care
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   indeed
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   damn unreal!
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   of course it's unrealisti
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   c
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it absolutely doesn't go well together with realism
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   MAKE IT REALISTIC
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i won't
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   THEN! :(
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   for that you'd need a realism mod
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   because it would require such extensive changes
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   no?
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   bye bye super-futuristic nanosuit, you know?
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   no
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   mostly goodbye strength jumping and sprinting faster in speed
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   I mean We are in 2010 our weapons today make more damage then Crysis we
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   apons in 2022
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   that doesn't matter
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   IT DOES!
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it's about making it a good game, not a realistic one
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   ...
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   if i'd want to make a realistic game, i'd make a realism mod
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   Crysis = realistic graphics and gameplay :)
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   make it that way
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i guess you just lost your sense of reality quite badly...
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   no
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   then why do you think crysis is realistic? lol
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   do LAWs have homing missils? no
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it's about as far from realism as a cat is from a turtle
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   SOME thing are realistic
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   forget it... If I ell you why     its a long history
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   but the entire design philosophy behind it is NOT realistic
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i'd love to have a realistic crysis mod though
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   but it's a lot of work
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   nanosuit = 75% unreal weapons = 90% real
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   cry-recon was well on the way, even though it wasn't entirely realistic
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   what? :/
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   Cryrecon is my favourite mod
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   pity it's dead
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   I know
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   Crysis mods never sucsseded
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   because there's no playerbase and the mod support sucks...
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   I tought cry-recon was going to... but its dead
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   yeah
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i was really looking forward to it
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   how nice... good things allways end
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   btw...
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   this metter sucks   you can't play tactical with this
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   metter?
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   at the left?
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   minimap?
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   yeah this bar on minimpa like sp
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   yeah
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it's experimental
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   ok
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it fits in well though, just not at this very moment
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   but when you're actually playing
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it's ok
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   Whjen you are running from a player... ooh -.- 
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   that bar helps
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i'll probably get rid of it anyway though
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   good
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   lol @ the flying
CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
   I am going back to IRC
CHAT Blablah to ALL:

CHAT Diogo+{B.O.S}+ to ALL:
