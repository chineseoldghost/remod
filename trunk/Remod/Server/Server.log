CHAT Shadez to ALL:
   ?!
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   eh, some people have a grudge against it
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   and no matter how it is
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   they'll always hate it because it has a nanosuit
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   he's not exactly good at it, so i guess that explains
CHAT TheBusDriver to ALL:
   well it's not really fun when you have to put 10+ bullets into someone 
CHAT TheBusDriver to ALL:
   to kill them
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it's different from CoD4...
CHAT TheBusDriver to ALL:
   it's different from every other shooter
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i think the main problem is it provides too many possibilities for peop
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   le
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   well, not too many
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   but a lot of people can't handle so many possibilities
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   which sounds whack but oh well...
CHAT TheBusDriver to ALL:
   craploads of possibilities but none of them are "good"
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   they're not OMGLOLOL YAAAAA THIS IS LIKE COD
CHAT TheBusDriver to ALL:
   well i died 111 times ...
CHAT TheBusDriver to ALL:
   maybe i just suck at fps
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i mean, there are no possibilities that make you feel better than other
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   s
CHAT Shadez to ALL:
   WTF?
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   and yeah it's pretty much because i've been playing this since the beta
CHAT TheBusDriver to ALL:
   besides mp isn't really appealing, i can't unlock anything, no statstra
CHAT TheBusDriver to ALL:
   cking, lack of gamemodes, ...
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it's a hard game
CHAT TheBusDriver to ALL:
   i'd call it unfinished
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it is
CHAT Shadez to ALL:
   meh
CHAT Shadez to ALL:
   bored of this map
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   but the nanosuit also makes it hard
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   most people don't like games that are hard above average...
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   :(
CHAT Shadez to ALL:
   ugh
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i can switch maps if you want
CHAT Shadez to ALL:
   ?!!
CHAT Shadez to ALL:
   LOL
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   oh man, you flew
CHAT Blablah to ALL:

CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i can switch maps if you tell me what map you want, lol
CHAT TheBusDriver to ALL:
   MESA!!!!!!1111
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   we can't really play on mesa though
CHAT TheBusDriver to ALL:
   i just say that because it's that map w/ a noob cliche :P
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   :P
CHAT Shadez to ALL:
   :(
CHAT TheBusDriver to ALL:
   it's a bloody pumpgun at this range every shot should be a kill
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i noted that down
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it used to do it
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   but it was OP
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   because when you have good aim and can get close to enemies
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   which you can
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   then you rape everyone with it
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   plus, realism and crysis don't go well together eh
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   it almost kills
CHAT Shadez to ALL:
   ahhgh
CHAT Shadez to ALL:

    built in...
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   i wonder what it's like in PS
CHAT Blablah to ALL:
   but PS is generally a PITA
CHAT Shadez to ALL:
