#summary Instructions on how to get neutral (test) builds of Remod with SVN.

_"In software development, a neutral build is a build that reflects the current state of the source code checked into the source code version control system by the developers, but without any developer-specific changes."_

===Requirements for Remod===
 * Crysis Wars with patch 1.5 installed
 * Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable. This is included in the Remod\Bin32\ folder.

===Instructions===
These are instructions on how to get neutral builds of Remod. Tests are planned on the Crymod IRC until I start organizing "official" tests.

 # Download TortoiseSVN for your system at http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.
 # Follow the installation process. Don't be put off by the required system restart; it's required.
 # Create a Remod folder in your Crysis Wars\Mods folder. If you have no Mods folder, create it.
 # Right-click the Remod folder you made and choose SVN Checkout.
 # You'll be greeted with a dialog. In the top input box, enter/paste http://remod.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Remod and click OK. Make sure Fully Recursive is selected in the dropdown menu and HEAD Revision is ticked. Hit OK and let it download; the initial download will be 100+ MB.
 # Update your working copy by right-clicking your Remod folder and choosing SVN Update. Do this before launching Remod, always.
 # Aside from the usual ways, you can launch Remod through the Play Remod shortcut in the Remod folder.
